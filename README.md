# MovieHub
This project is a simple Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) website application that fetches and retrieves API data from various websites (TheMovieDatabase). The proponents aim to build a movie database that allows users to create their own accounts, view movies, bookmark movies, and sort and filter movies.
